# Discrete-Math-Graph-Library
A pretty bog-standard and unprofessional graph library made by 3 CS undergrads for our discrete maths class.

It has a couple of graphviz output functions, as declared in iodot.h. Use it to gaze at the marvelous powers of Graphviz, which is, fun fact, made by actual competent people.

If you want to utilize this pretty confusing C library to your liking, feel free to take a gander at our test folder to find your way through all of this madness.

Makefile will be updated soon... if we still have the brain cells to *actually* finish this project.
