# Discrete-Math-Graph-Library
A pretty bog-standard and unprofessional graph library made by 3 CS undergrads for our discrete maths class.
It has some graphviz output functions, as declared in iodot.h.
If you want to utilize this pretty confusing C library to your liking, feel free to take a gander at our test folder to find your way through all of this madness.
Makefile will be updated soon... if we still have the brain cells to *actually* finish this project.
